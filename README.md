# Amazon Customer Review Sentiment Analysis

This project leverages Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and Transformers to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon customer reviews. By employing advanced natural language processing techniques, it aims to understand and classify the sentiment expressed in customer feedback on Amazon products.

## Features:

1. Data Collection: Utilizes Amazon Product Advertising API or web scraping techniques to gather customer reviews from Amazon.
2. Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the raw text data, including tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming/lemmatization.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Applies both traditional NLTK-based sentiment analysis techniques and modern Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT) to analyze and classify the sentiment of each review.
4. Model Evaluation: Assesses the performance of different sentiment analysis models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualization: Generates visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distributions, and confusion matrices to provide insights into the sentiment patterns within the Amazon reviews
